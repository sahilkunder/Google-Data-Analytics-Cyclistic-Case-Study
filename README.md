# Google-Data-Analytics-Cyclistic-Case-Study
## Introduction ##
For my Capstone Project I decided to work on the Cyclistic bike share case study. This particular case study involves preforming real-world tasks as a junior data analyst in order to answer the key business questions.

## Scenario ##
As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike share company based in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use the products differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. Our subsequent recommendations should be backed with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to be approved by the Cyclistic executives.

## Background ##
To answer the key business questions, I broke down the data analysis process into six key stages: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share** and **Act**, as taught in the Google Analytics Course.

### Tools used ###
- **Excel** and **BigQuery** for cleaning and validating data formats
- **BigQuery** for data anlysis
- **Tableau** for data visualization
