# Google-Data-Analytics-Cyclistic-Case-Study
## Introduction ##
For my Capstone Project I decided to work on the Cyclistic bike share case study. This particular case study involves preforming real-world tasks as a junior data analyst in order to answer the key business questions.

To answer the key business questions, I broke down the data analysis process into six key stages: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act, as taught in the Google Analytics Course.
